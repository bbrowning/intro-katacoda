In this self paced tutorial you will learn how to use Apache OpenWhisk to deploy and invoke functions.

## Let's get started

If you are not familiar with Apache OpenWhisk, it's worth taking a few minutes to understand the basics of the platform as well as the environment that you will be using for this self paced tutorial.

Describe that in more detail here.

### Command Line Interface

The command line tool that we will be using as part of this training is called the *wsk* tool.  This tool is written in the Go programming language and is a single executable that is provided for Windows, OS X, and the Linux Operating Systems.

### The Environment

During this training course you will be using Apache OpenWhisk running on top of a hosted OpenShift environment that is created just for you.  This environment is not shared with other users of the system.  Because each user taking this training has their own environment, we had to make some concessions to ensure the overall platform is stable and used only for this training.  For that reason, your environment will only be active for a one hour period.  Keep this in mind before embarking on getting through the content.  Each time you start this training, a new environment will be created on the fly.
 
The OpenShift environment that has been created for you is running the latest version of our open source project called OpenShift Origin.  This deployment is a self contained environment that provides everything you need to be successful in learning the platform.  This includes such things as the command line, web console, and public URLs.

With that being said, grab your favorite choice of beverage and let's do this!
